# IBM-312-Breast-Cancer-Classification

This was a group assignment for our course IBM 312 Data Mining for Business Intelligence.
We used the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set [Link](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/breast+cancer+wisconsin+%28diagnostic%29)

We have tried to solve the breast cancer classification problem using the three popular machine learning classifiers: SVM, Logistic Regression and KNN. After data preprocessing and normalization, we used PCA for dimensionality reduction and data visualization. Finally, we employ GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning for each model to obtain the best performance on test data.

The accuracy results were:

  SVM                  : 97% 
  Logistic Regression  : 97%
  KNN                  : 95%
